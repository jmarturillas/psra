1. `log.html`
2. `output.xml`
3. `report.html`

- If you prefer to run it with Firefox, just change the value of `browser` variable to `firefox` as in `browser:firefox`
- The browser will open and do as what the steps in the exam requires. (please see the `TestHomePage.robot` for the reference of the keywords being run)
- After the execution, there will 3 files generated related to result of the test. To see the report, open the `log.html` from the root directory of this repository to your desired browser.
